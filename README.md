How to create a script that will turn all 2D images put into specific folder into sprites automatically

After starting up Unity, create a new folder called **Editors**, this is because the editor scripts cannot be in the same folder as other scripts as this will cause errors. After creating the folder open it and create a C# script and call it however you feel is the most applicable for what its intended purpose is. For this case, let's call it **SpriteProcessor**.

Next, open the script and delete the **start** and **update** functions as they are not needed. Then add in **using UnityEditor** at the top as the script will not work without it. Next write the following parenthesis below:

void OnPostprocessTexture(Texture2D texture)
    {
        string lowerCaseAssetPath = assetPath.ToLower();
        bool isInSpriteDirectory = lowerCaseAssetPath.IndexOf("/sprites/") != -1;

        if (isInSpriteDirectory)
        {
            TextureImporter textureImporter = (TextureImporter) assetImporter;
            textureImporter.textureType = TextureImporterType.Sprite;
        }
    }
